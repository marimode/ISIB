       <p class="answears">ISIB's mission is to aid rising or current IB students by providing resources of explanation, advice and sharing experiences. It is purposed at easing the journey to the DP from the point of view of IBDP students in years 1 and 2 in a somewhat informal manner; though since the IB is ever-changing, it's worth to note that at some points certain aspects of this website, if not all of it may contain invalid information as it becomes outdated.</p>
       <h1 class="text">What is ISIB?</h1>
       <p class="answears">ISIB is a website made by 3 IB students studying at different schools around the globe experiencing the IB in various ways. Derived from the need of more accessible help, ISIB aims at filling in a space that IB guides, booklets, and presentations leave uncovered. To do this, ISIB includes simplified explanations of assessments and some tips and trick to guide you through the IB, in addition to accounts of personal experiences to demonstrate what the IB can be like and how despite it being a singular, internationally recognized system, it still has differences here and there that often have big impacts one your learning experience and academic life. </p>
       <h1 class="text">What is IB (DP)?</h1>
       <p class="answears">The International Baccalaureate has 4 programs (as of the making of this website; 2022) the Primary Years Program (PYP, 3-12yrs old), Middle Years Program (MYP, 11-16 yrs old), Diploma Programme (DP, 16-18yrs) and Careers Program (CP, 18-21 yrs old). ISIB will only focus on and detail the Diploma Programme, also known as IBDP, which is taken the last two years of highschool. “The Diploma Programme (DP) curriculum is made up of six subject groups and the DP core, comprising theory of knowledge (TOK), creativity, activity, service (CAS) and the extended essay. Through the Diploma Programme (DP) core, students reflect on the nature of knowledge, complete independent research and undertake a project that often involves community service.” <sup>1</sup></p>

             <p>" I think IB gives you a taste of university and academic experiences. Hence, I thought they also offered for the students to master research skills and planning abilities. I wanted personally and intellectually to grow. My goal was to develop the ability to articulate my opinions. Most importantly I like challenges and learning through experiences."</p>
