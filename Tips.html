        <b>Subject selections: </b>
        <ul>
            <li>Before starting the DP years, review your subject selections and ensure that you are satisfied with your choice. I had a couple of classmates who changed their subjects in the middle of the semester and struggled to catch up. </li>
            <li>Ask yourself if the subject fits your interests. Then consider changing it as early as possible (year 1). </li>
            <li>You can speak to your IB coordinator who will give you advice about it; before starting the IB, make sure to become familiar with the subject's syllabus and how the IB system works. For example, If I could go back, I would also try to improve my English skills, since you’re constantly required to do a lot of writing. </li>
        </ul>
        <b>Being organized:</b>
        <p>During the DP years, it is advised to stay organized. Time management is a crucial thing for the program. Get started on something as soon as you can, do not procrastinate, and if you have time, try to revise previous topics. <br>
             <b><i> How to manage:</b></i> </p>
             <b>Time:</b>
        <ul>
            <li class="fancy_bulletpoint">Timetables, schedules, etc are really helpful for some people, though they're not for everyone because they can actually be sources of stress rather than managers of it.</li>
            <li class="fancy_bulletpoint">Reminders: post-it notes on the walls or screen, on your phone (apps), scribbles on a napkin, friends’ texts, whatever works best for you, just make sure it catches your attention easily</li>
        </ul>
        <b>Assessments (HW, IAs, etc):</b>
        <ul>
            <li class="fancy_bulletpoint">Avoid procrastination. There are many ways to complete tasks as they come, but keep in mind these suggestions don't work for everyone. One way to procrastinate less is making or joining study groups; though these are not always reliable sources, peer pressure does tend to increase productivity. Another, more obvious way, is to get rid of distractions of any kind. Turning off notifications on your phone, closing the window from outside noise, sitting in a comfy place, etc are all ways to eliminate disturbances and interruptions. However, recognizing your personal and specific distractions takes time, so don't expect to be a master concentrator on the first day.</li>
            <li class="fancy_bulletpoint">Keep track of time. You can use alarms, a watch, a schedule, set routines, or other methods. Know your optimal working hours, whether it's early in the morning, or late hours of the night, and ensure you take advantage of them. Once again, figuring out what works best for you is a matter of time, patience, and reflection; all extremely useful skills to learn before university and life in general.</li>
            <li class="fancy_bulletpoint">CITATIONS (suuuuuper important) don't forget them</li>
            <li class="fancy_bulletpoint">Clear up any questions with teacher(s) as soon as possible</li>
            <li class="fancy_bulletpoint">Breaks: 8 hours of working non-stop is not as effective as you think. Taking breaks, and being conscious of how long they are without it stressing you out, is key to constant productivity. For some people, this is easier to manage than for others since hyperfocus tends to cause you to forget everything outside your task, and overstimulation can derail a train of thought so constantly you forget everything. How to know when you need a break? When you feel like your brain is going to implode on itself. :) The purpose of taking breaks is to not reach that point of feeling as though your brain is nothing but mush, taking them every 30 mins to an hour or so (time heavily varies depending on the person) prevents brain implosions.</li>
            <li class="fancy_bulletpoint">Balancing social life and academics: Be responsible and reasonable about social hours, its not the end of the world if you can't hang out for one extra hour, you and your friends should be mature enough to recognize what is a responsible “no” and what isn't.</li>
        </ul>
        <b> CAS:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Take pictures or videos. Keeping evidence is very important, since CAS is something you do on your own you need to keep it updated every week, keeping evidence also shows improvement. </li>
            <li>Talk with your teachers/CAS advisors. Go over ideas to make sure that they work. Teachers and CAS advisors also help clear up your questions and make your experiences better by suggesting helpful ideas and interests. </li>
            <li>Reflect upon what you have achieved. Default questions to ask yourself →  “What went well?,” what didn’t go well?,” “How could that be improved?” “What is the bigger picture, and what was my role in it?”Etc.  </li>
        </ul>
        <b>Study tips for exams: </b>
        <ul>
            <li>Outline all topics, circle those which you know you don't understand and start with studying those</li>
            <li>Explaining what you’ve learned to somebody else/ teaching somebody else</li>
            <li>Flash cards (Quizlet or physical for ex); Sticky notes</li>
            <li>Making short summaries of chapters by hand</li>
            <li>Look at and complete past papers to familiarize with the types of questions and their format</li>
            <li>Revise topics <i> right after</i> class if possible</li>
            <li>For practice based subjects like math or drama, keep practicing as much as you can every moment you have available.</li>
        </ul>
        <b>Engagement in class</b>
        <p>It is important to be active in class by raising your hand and answering what your teacher is asking you. Get engaged and push yourself to express your opinions. Even answering a question incorrectly can help you remember the information for the future, so any discomfort now will be well worth it later. If you are a shy person try 3 seconds rule. Once you make eye contact with someone on a count of three you should say something. Now, this rule allows you to follow through it and gives you the energy to say something. </p>
        <b>Conclusion</b>
        <p>IB taught me not to compare myself to others. I felt anxious while I was writing any internal assessment because I thought mine was the worst. Try to make it work for you by moving at your own pace. You should engage with your teachers. If you find something to be challenging ask for help. Plus there are tons of IB resources on the internet. Try to overcome your hindering challenge. </p>

                        ISIB's mission is to aid rising or current IB students by providing resources of explanation, advice and sharing experiences. It is purposed at easing the journey to the DP from the point of view of IBDP students in years 1 and 2 in a somewhat informal manner; though since the IB is ever-changing, it's worth to note that at some points certain aspects of this website, if not all of it may contain invalid information as it becomes outdated.
