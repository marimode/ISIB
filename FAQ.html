            <h3>Why choose IB? </h3>
         </div>
              <div class="answear">
                  <p>
                    IB increases students' chance of getting into the college or university of their choosing. In addition, the student will get the knowledge and abilities required to succeed in their future carrier.

            <h3>What is CAS?</h3>
         </div>
              <div class="answear">
                  <p>
                    CAS is one of the three extra mandatory things that comes with the diploma programme, it stands for ‚ÄúCreativity, Activity, Service‚Äù and as such requires you to meet creative, active and service expectations. This means that in addition to all academic work, students must be proactive in growing themselves as a person by developing and working creative minds, keeping their bodies active, and aiding their community in whatever way they can. Community service is already common in most highschools so the ‚Äúcreativity‚Äù and ‚Äúactivity‚Äù part are sort of the new things. ‚ÄúSort of '' because they‚Äôre actually really simple, they count as any activity that requires you to either be creative/think creatively, or be physically active/participate in a sport. Since many students stop taking PE and Arts classes once in the DP, CAS aims to fill those gaps and keep a holistic approach to education. Besides regular small or constant activities, a CAS project is also mandatory. A project is an activity that takes much more dedication and effort than the others, and you treat it with nearly as much importance as your academic studies; a project, like some of your activities, may also cover more than one aspect: creativity, activity and/or service.

            <h3>What is TOK? (essay, exhibition IA)</h3>
         </div>
              <div class="answear">
                  <p>Theory of Knowledge (TOK) is part of the IB Diploma Programme. Theory Of Knowledge helps students to think about WHAT they know and HOW they know, to critically understand and reflect on their own beliefs or assumptions which helps them lead to more reasonable conclusions and responsible lifestyles. 
                    TOK is assessed through an exhibition (IA) , a 1600 word essay that explores different areas of knowledge. (assessments change overtime)

            <h3 class="hide">What is EE?</h3>
         </div>
              <div class="answear">
                 <p>Extended Essay is an independent research paper completed throughout the 2DP years on a topic chosen by a student. Students get EE supervisors who will consult and give feedback during the process. The academic writing should be no more than 4000 words. Furthermore, EE needs to be supported with reflections that shall be recorded in ManageBac. The Extended Essay process introduces students and gets them used to what academic papers are like at university, it prepares them for any research challenges they may face in the future. It is externally graded on a scale from A to E. The awarded score will contribute up to three points to the IB diploma. </p>

            <h3>What is ManageBac?</h3>
         </div>
              <div class="answear">
                  <p>ManageBac is a platform used by many IB schools to record CAS experiences, EE process and reflections and occasionally certain subjects' assessments/progress (for ex you may have your Individual Learner Portfolio for Language A in ManageBac). Students and teachers have a slightly different interfaces with different functions. Students can track their attendance, timetable and assignment. </p>

            <h3>When do students actually study IBDP?</h3>
         </div>
              <div class="answear">
                 <p>     The last two years of high school (16 to 19 years old). DP prepares students for six IB exams (3 HL; 3 SL) as well as the TOK, CAS and EE.</p>

            <h3>How the students are graded?</h3>
         </div>
              <div class="answear">
              <p>IB courses are graded similarly to regular high school courses, but with IB criteria. IB exam results have no bearing on a student's high school record. The IB grades range from 1-7, with anything below a 4 being a failing grade, but these only apply for your course subjects. TOK, EE, and CAS are graded differently; TOK and EE are given grades from A to E and together can give you up to 3 additional points (remember, tha min required points is 24 to pass and the max possible is 45)

            <h3>How much homework do IB students have?</h3>
         </div>
              <div class="answear">
               <p>It is anticipated that each class will assign you 20-30 homework each night. Therefore, it will take more than one hour to complete the homework. But it also depends on your timetable and the deadline of the tasks. On average students spend 3-4 hours studying and revising the topics. Hence, study regularly to enhance your knowledge. Do your homework or other assessments on time because it will be hard and stressful to catch up. </p>

            <h3>Is IB better than AP and A-levels?</h3>
         </div>
              <div class="answear">
            <p>
                AP is a program that introduces high school students to college-level courses. It gives them the opportunity to earn college credit before even finishing high school and it raises their admission chances. Even though both AP and IB courses require students to work hard, AP and IB have different goals. The AP aims to give students access to college-level courses by offering them a variety of exams to take. There is no other requirement to fulfill outside the exam for each subject. You also have the possibility to take AP exams without taking the classes. IB emphasizes encouraging students to develop their knowledge and critical thinking. Additionally, IB encourages students to practice their abilities outside of the classroom and be socially engaged. To conclude, you should choose the program that will benefit you. You can also enroll in both of the programs, which can (will) be difficult. AP offers to only take courses that you want to study, while IB offers a more holistic approach to receiving a diploma. To conclude, you should consider which program is better and right for you. </p>

           <p>Internal Assessment (IA) is an individual assessment where the teachers and schools judge a students performance. The IA is worth 25% for the final assessment for SL students, and 20% for HL students. To start the IA you need to: <br>

            <h3>What are the requirements for the IB diploma vs certificate</h3>
         </div>
              <div class="answear">
           <p>The requirements for the IB diploma can be pretty complicated and hard to understand, even after having heard them a million times. Its first important to differentiate between what you need for the diploma and what you need for the certificate, especially if you feel like you're going to fail. See, the certificate is sort of a safety net if you fail the diploma; that is to say, in the event that you fail the diploma (aka don't meet the requirements) you can still get the certificate. While a certificate may seem less impressive to universities, its still an acknowledgement of academically rigorous courses and thus still holds value.
            To get a diploma, you can't fail any subject (failing is getting less than a 4 out of 7), you have to take and pass TOK (Theory of knowledge), complete the EE (extended essay) and do CAS (Community Activity and Service). The certificate allows and for the EE to be optional and also does not require Creativity nor Activity, just regular community service which in many schools is already mandatory for all highschoolers regardless  if they're in they‚Äôre enrolled in the IB or not.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>No fewer than 24 points in 6 Subject + TOK/EE/CAS</li>
                <li>CAS requirements have been met.</li>
                <li>There‚Äôs no ‚ÄúN‚Äù for TOK/ EE</li>
                <li>There‚Äôs no ‚ÄúE‚Äù for TOK and/or EE</li>
                <li>There are no more than two grade 2s awarded</li>
                <li>There are no more than three grade 3s or below awarded</li>
                <li>12 points or more are awarded on HL subjects</li>
                <li>9 points and more are awarded on SL subjects</li>
                <li>All of the requirements are met within a maximum of three examination sessions.</li>
                <li>The candidate has not received a penalty for academic misconduct from the final award committee</li>

        <div class="question">
            <h3>Do students have a life outside of class work in IB?</h3>
         </div>
              <div class="answear">
            <p> It depends a lot on the person. Time management is key for the IB, how you spend your time very frequently determines your success and enjoyment of free time. Being an expert procrastinator tends to come and bite you back in a not-so-good way. Yes, you will have a life outside of your studies, you will have time to go out, have fun and spend time with friends so dont worry. But know that for all its pompous talk, the IB does require a lot of time and dedication, especially if you‚Äôre taking subjects like HL Math AA . Taking advantage of all class time and school hours and also taking regular short breaks is an extremely efficient way to maximize productivity and allow for some free time on the weekend and/or following weekdays. Since the workload can be heavy in certain combinations of subjects, usually a talk with your IB coordinator ensures you‚Äôre placed in courses rigorous enough but also realistically doable for you and based on that in addition to your time managements skills, you‚Äôre definitely guaranteed a life outside academics.</p>

    <div class="faq">
        <div class="question">
            <h3>Can you switch schools (move) in the middle of the DP?</h3>
         </div>
              <div class="answear">
               <p>Yes, but it's complicated. A meeting with your IB coordinator is advised, whether you're sure you‚Äôre going to move or not. Different schools have different schedules for assessments as well as offer different subjects, for that reason, its recommended to look for new schools in your new place which have the same or similar subjects. Even then, you may be behind or ahead when you move, this is because its up to the individual teacher to choose which units are taught first and how. Obviously you will have a different experience because how a subject is delivered is heavily dependent on the teacher, some teachers you may actually like more, some you'll prefer you‚Äôd had your old one. In the occasion than you move countries and not just schools, you'll notice different groups of students and teachers in different sociocultural contexts will bring very different things to the classroom. As for assessments, some schools choose to schedules IO‚Äôs for the end of Year one, others may choose to do it earlier or even later. Some schools have two semesters of TOK, some have the entire two years. Some schools start the EE in the first year, others start it in the second. When things happen is heavily dependent on your school and IB coordinator, that‚Äôs why a chat with them can clarify any doubts you have and in an academic sense you're all set to go off to your next school.</p>

                    ISIB's mission is to aid rising or current IB students by providing resources of explanation, advice and sharing experiences. It is purposed at easing the journey to the DP from the point of view of IBDP students in years 1 and 2 in a somewhat informal manner; though since the IB is ever-changing, it's worth to note that at some points certain aspects of this website, if not all of it may contain invalid information as it becomes outdated.
